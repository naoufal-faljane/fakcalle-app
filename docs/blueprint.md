# **App Name**: SudokuZen

## Core Features:

- Grid Generation: Generate a 9x9 Sudoku grid with randomized initial values based on difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Game Logic: Implement core game logic: validating puzzle solutions, checking for errors in user input, and managing the game state.
- Input Method: Provide a number pad for direct input and a 'Notes' mode to allow users to pencil in potential numbers.
- Utility Buttons: Implement an 'Undo' button to revert the last move, a 'New Game' button to start a fresh puzzle, and a 'Reset' button to clear all user inputs.
- Timer: Track the time elapsed during the game to allow the user to gauge their solving speed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) for a focused and intellectual atmosphere.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure good contrast and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#E6E6FA) to highlight interactive elements and provide visual cues.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; good for both headlines and body text.
- Design the interface to resemble a native Android application, with a fixed grid layout, bottom-aligned number pad, and appropriately sized touch targets.
- Employ simple, minimalist icons for actions like 'Undo', 'New Game', 'Reset', and 'Notes', ensuring they are easily understandable at a glance.
- Implement subtle animations for actions such as number placement, error alerts, and game completion to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
